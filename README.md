# Online/Offline Budget Trackers
============

## Description

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, it will populate the total when brought back online.

## Process

I started out by installing all the necessary npm libraries and creating necessary folders based on the MVC structure.Started with creating the server first and then the routes and the necessary files for data modeling and then the used the MangoDb to do the database transactions.
